feat: Implement enterprise-grade OOP/SOLID principles and comprehensive security framework

üèóÔ∏è MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL REFACTORING

This commit implements a complete architectural overhaul of the SOAP application, introducing enterprise-grade Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and SOLID principles throughout the codebase, along with a comprehensive security framework.

## üéØ OOP CONCEPTS IMPLEMENTED

### ‚úÖ Encapsulation
- Private methods for internal logic (validation, notifications, logging)
- Protected methods in BaseController for derived classes
- Proper access modifiers throughout all classes
- Data hiding with controlled access through properties

### ‚úÖ Inheritance
- BaseController with common functionality for all controllers
- Template Method Pattern for consistent request handling
- Proper inheritance hierarchies with LSP compliance
- Shared security audit logging across controllers

### ‚úÖ Polymorphism
- Strategy Pattern for notification services (SMS, Email)
- Strategy Pattern for document validation (PDF, Image)
- Interface-based dependency injection throughout
- Runtime behavior selection based on context

### ‚úÖ Abstraction
- Clear interface contracts hiding implementation complexity
- Service abstractions for business logic separation
- Simplified public APIs with complex internal logic
- Domain model abstractions for data operations

## üß± SOLID PRINCIPLES IMPLEMENTATION

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- ApplicationService: Only handles application business logic
- NotificationService: Only handles notification orchestration
- DocumentValidators: Each handles specific document types
- Controllers: Act as coordinators, not processors
- Each class has one clear reason to change

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Strategy Pattern for notifications (extensible without modification)
- Strategy Pattern for document validation (pluggable validators)
- New notification types can be added via INotificationStrategy
- New document validators via IDocumentValidator interface

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- All controllers can substitute BaseController
- All notification strategies can substitute INotificationStrategy
- All validators can substitute IDocumentValidator
- Proper inheritance hierarchies maintain behavioral contracts

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Granular interfaces (INotificationStrategy, IDocumentValidator)
- Clients only depend on methods they actually use
- No fat interfaces forcing unnecessary dependencies
- Focused contracts for specific responsibilities

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- All services depend on abstractions, not concretions
- Comprehensive dependency injection configuration
- High-level modules independent of low-level modules
- Testable architecture through interface injection

## üîê COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY FRAMEWORK

### Security Entity Framework Configuration
- SecurityAuditLogConfiguration: Comprehensive audit trail setup
- DataProcessingConsentConfiguration: GDPR/Kenya Data Protection Act compliance
- LoginAttemptConfiguration: Brute force attack monitoring

### Security Entities
- SecurityAuditLog: Detailed security event logging
- DataProcessingConsent: User consent tracking

### Authorization Framework

- ParentDataAccessRequirement: Parent data isolation
- Row-level security through authorization handlers
- Custom authorization policies for granular access control

### Security Middleware & Services
- SecurityHeadersMiddleware: Comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- SecurityMonitoringService: Real-time threat detection
- DataRetentionService: Automated data lifecycle management
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Enhanced Entity Security
- Encrypted personal data markers in entities
- Security audit fields in User, Application, Document
- GDPR compliance properties (deletion tracking)
- Performance indexes for security monitoring
