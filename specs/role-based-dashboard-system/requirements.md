# Role-Based Dashboard System Requirements

## Introduction

The SOAP application needs a comprehensive role-based dashboard system that provides different levels of access and functionality based on user roles. The system owner (Platform Admin) requires platform management capabilities, while School Admins need complete control over their school's data, and Parents need access only to their personal application data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Platform Admin Dashboard System

**User Story:** As a Platform Admin (system owner), I want a comprehensive root-level dashboard with platform management capabilities, so that I can monitor system health and manage school accounts while maintaining SaaS compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log in as a Platform Admin THEN I SHALL be redirected to a root-level dashboard at `/Dashboard`
2. WHEN I access the root dashboard THEN I SHALL see system-wide metrics, performance data, and aggregated analytics
3. WHEN I view school data THEN I SHALL only see anonymized metrics and account status information
4. WHEN I manage school accounts THEN I SHALL be able to create, suspend, or delete school tenants
5. IF I need to access customer data THEN I SHALL require explicit authorization from the school admin
6. WHEN I manage billing THEN I SHALL see subscription status and usage metrics for all schools
7. WHEN I view system reports THEN I SHALL see platform health, security incidents, and usage analytics

### Requirement 2: School Admin Complete School Access

**User Story:** As a School Admin, I want complete administrative control over my school's data and users, so that I can manage all aspects of my school's admission process independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log in as a School Admin THEN I SHALL be redirected to the admin area with school-filtered data
2. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN I SHALL only see statistics and data for my assigned school
3. WHEN I access applications THEN I SHALL only see applications submitted to my school
4. WHEN I view documents THEN I SHALL only see documents related to my school's applications
5. WHEN I manage students THEN I SHALL only see students assigned to my school
6. IF I attempt to access other schools' data THEN I SHALL be denied access with appropriate error messages
7. WHEN I view reports THEN I SHALL only see analytics for my school's performance
8. WHEN I send communications THEN I SHALL only be able to contact parents with applications to my school

### Requirement 3: Parent Personal Data Access

**User Story:** As a Parent, I want access to my personal application data and progress tracking, so that I can monitor my child's admission process without accessing administrative functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log in as a Parent THEN I SHALL be redirected to the parent portal dashboard
2. WHEN I view my dashboard THEN I SHALL only see my own application data and status
3. WHEN I access documents THEN I SHALL only see documents I have uploaded for my applications
4. WHEN I view communications THEN I SHALL only see messages related to my applications
5. IF I attempt to access admin areas THEN I SHALL be denied access and redirected to my portal
6. WHEN I view application status THEN I SHALL see real-time updates for my child's admission progress
7. WHEN I upload documents THEN I SHALL only be able to attach them to my own applications

### Requirement 4: Dynamic Permission Enforcement

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automatic permission enforcement based on user roles, so that data security is maintained without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user accesses data THEN the system SHALL automatically filter results based on their role and permissions
2. WHEN a School Admin queries applications THEN the system SHALL automatically add SchoolId filters to all database queries
3. WHEN a Parent accesses any data THEN the system SHALL automatically filter by their UserId
4. IF a user attempts unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access
5. WHEN user roles change THEN the system SHALL immediately update their access permissions
6. WHEN displaying navigation menus THEN the system SHALL only show options available to the user's role
7. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL automatically scope data to the user's permission level

### Requirement 5: Role-Based Navigation and UI

**User Story:** As a user of any role, I want the interface to adapt to my permissions and responsibilities, so that I only see relevant features and avoid confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log in THEN I SHALL see a navigation menu tailored to my role's capabilities
2. WHEN I view dashboards THEN I SHALL see widgets and charts relevant to my access level
3. WHEN I access forms THEN I SHALL only see fields and options I'm authorized to modify
4. IF certain features are restricted THEN they SHALL be hidden from my interface entirely
5. WHEN I view data tables THEN I SHALL only see columns and actions appropriate for my role
6. WHEN I access help documentation THEN I SHALL see role-specific guidance and instructions
7. WHEN I use search functions THEN results SHALL be automatically filtered to my permission scope

### Requirement 6: Audit Trail and Security Monitoring

**User Story:** As a Platform Admin, I want comprehensive logging of all role-based access attempts, so that I can monitor system security and user behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user accesses data THEN the system SHALL log the access attempt with user role and data scope
2. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL create detailed security audit logs
3. WHEN School Admins access cross-school data THEN the system SHALL log and prevent the access
4. IF suspicious access patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL alert Platform Admins
5. WHEN generating audit reports THEN I SHALL see role-based access statistics and violations
6. WHEN users change roles THEN the system SHALL log the change and notify relevant administrators
7. WHEN data is modified THEN the system SHALL record which role performed the action and their authorization level
